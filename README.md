## Description
Späti Near Me is the final project for the React course at ReDI School, developed by our team. This application helps users find Spätis (late-night convenience stores) near a specified address or neighborhood using Mapbox for map display and geolocation.

## Features
- **Map Display**: Utilizes Mapbox to show a map with the location of Spätis.
- **Geolocation**: Allows users to find Spätis near their current location or a specific address.
- **Nearby Spätis**: Displays the three nearest Spätis to the provided address.
- **Filters**: Users can filter Spätis based on the following amenities:
  - Tables for seating
  - Restrooms
  - Credit card acceptance
- **Data Submission**: Users can submit a form to add new Spätis to our database.
